## Summary

The project supports quick lookup of results to help programmers work effectively with Navisworks. Originally this was a
research project developed by Autodesk team, but now they need to be fixed and improved a lot, so I decided to rebuild
and maintain it to help.Easy to use by programmers for the purposes of creating tools for the AEC industry.
